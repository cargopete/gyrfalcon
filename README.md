# Gyrfalcon

Gyrfalcon is an open-source terminal coding agent written in Rust and designed
for Rust work. It runs against a deliberately bounded set of strong hosted and
open-weight models rather than assuming that every model behaves like one API
wearing a false moustache.

It is also a serious educational implementation of the machinery behind tools
such as Claude Code and Codex, published with its design record, its failures
and its measurements. Several of those measurements went against the design, and
those are written down too.

## Status

`gyr` opens an interactive session. It selects a model, builds a provider-native
session, streams each turn, classifies every tool call, enforces an approval
policy in code, runs processes inside an operating-system sandbox, records
everything to an append-only log, and cancels a turn on Ctrl-C without inventing
a terminal event the provider never sent or losing the conversation.

`gyr run` is the same machinery as one submission and an exit code, for scripts,
CI and evals.

### What works

- **Three native transports.** OpenAI Responses, Anthropic Messages and Qwen
  Chat Completions, each keeping its own conversation state so continuation does
  not lose reasoning items or content ordering. Recorded parser tests
  throughout; Qwen and Anthropic also have local HTTP/SSE wire tests. Only
  Anthropic has been driven against a live endpoint.
- **Six tools.** `read` returns bounded, numbered, fingerprinted ranges.
  `search` is literal and ignore-aware with explicit totals. `list` shows what is
  in the workspace through the same ignore rules, with `all` to see what those
  rules hide. `apply_patch` replaces one exact occurrence and refuses a stale or
  ambiguous edit. `exec` runs one program with one argument vector, no shell.
  `cargo` runs a closed set of subcommands and returns parsed diagnostics, so an
  `E0308` arrives as a level, a code, a file, a line and a column rather than as
  a page of compiler output.
- **Approval enforced below the model.** Every call is classified read-only,
  mutating or process. Read-only calls proceed. Anything else asks, and a session
  rule is keyed on the tool and the resolved target, never on a description of
  what a command probably does. A refusal returns to the model as an ordinary
  tool result under its original call ID.
- **A line-based session.** Not an alternate-screen interface, deliberately: the
  transcript belongs in the terminal's scrollback, where a person goes to find
  what the agent did an hour ago and where selection and copying still work.
  Paste arrives as one message; a trailing backslash continues a typed line.
- **Resumable sessions.** `gyr --resume` continues the most recent conversation
  in the workspace, or a named one. What is persisted is the adapter's own native
  history rather than the session log, because the log holds normalised events
  and rebuilding a provider's content ordering from those would reconstruct
  something plausible rather than something identical. A state from another
  provider, model or payload version is refused rather than half-loaded.
- **A context budget.** A session used to grow until the provider refused the
  request and then keep refusing, without saying why. It now watches reported
  input tokens against the model's documented window, says so once at 70%, and
  past 85% hollows out the oldest tool results, keeping the calls, the text and
  every call ID, with a marker naming what went. Elision rather than
  summarisation: no extra request, deterministic, and it does not quietly rewrite
  what the model believes happened.
- **A session log, and a way to read it back.** Append-only JSONL holding what
  you asked, the proposed action, the decision, the execution and the result.
  `gyr replay` renders a past session through the same renderer the live one
  uses, with `--last N` for the recent exchanges.
- **Configuration, split by who wrote it.** `~/.config/gyr/config.toml` for your
  defaults, `<workspace>/.gyr/config.toml` for a project's. The second arrives
  with the repository, so it may set preferences and may **not** set `approvals`,
  `sandbox` or `api_base`: the first two weaken a boundary and the third
  redirects where a credential is sent. A project file that tries is an error
  naming the file and the key. No file holds a credential at any layer.
- **An eval harness.** `gyr eval` runs a corpus of cases: a fixture workspace, a
  prompt, and assertions about the outcome. Assertions decide pass or fail;
  metrics decide nothing and are read back out of the session log, which is also
  how the log's sufficiency gets tested. `--without <tool>` hides a tool as
  completely as if it had never been built, which is how several of the findings
  below were obtained.

### What is enforced, and what is not

On macOS and Linux every process runs inside an operating-system sandbox that
confines writes to the workspace: Seatbelt on one, Landlock on the other, behind
one trait. **Neither confines reads.** A build script can still read a credential
file; what it cannot do is write it outside the workspace or transmit it. That
combination is the guarantee, and RFC-0009 section 2 explains why a narrower read
profile was rejected rather than attempted badly.

The two are not identical and are not labelled as though they were. Seatbelt
denies the network outright; Landlock ABI 4 denies TCP and leaves UDP open, so it
says `TCP denied` rather than `network denied`. Making the weaker one wear the
stronger one's words is the failure that document exists to avoid.

One consequence is load-bearing. RFC-0001 lists automatic commits, pushes,
deployments and purchases as non-goals. Under confinement `git push` fails with
`connect to host github.com port 22: Operation not permitted`, because the
sandbox refused the socket rather than because its name is on a list. There is no
list.

On every other platform the sandbox is unimplemented and Gyrfalcon refuses to run
any process rather than quietly running it unconfined. `--sandbox none` remains
available, is never the default, appears in the approval prompt as `unconfined`,
and is written into the session log. Windows is not a target.

### What does not exist yet

Shells and pipelines. Context relief for OpenAI, whose server-side continuation
keeps no local history to reduce, and which wants a live credential to verify
rather than merely to write. Summarising compaction. Rollback: the diagnostic
gate refused rather than reverting, because a shadow copy of the workspace is a
worse version of git. Resuming *from* a log as opposed to replaying one, which
RFC-0014 section 2 argues cannot be done honestly. A conformance suite: RFC-0003
lists twelve provider scenarios and none has run against a live endpoint.

These are missing features. None is delegated to the system prompt and none is
claimed to be present.

## What the corpus has changed

The eval corpus is nine cases, which is a start rather than a corpus. All nine
pass against `claude-sonnet-5`. It exists to answer questions this repository
would otherwise settle by argument, and it has now overruled the argument four
times.

**A missing capability, not a missing syntax.** The one `exec` call across six
cases was `find . -name "*.rs"`. Not a pipeline: a directory listing, which
nothing else offered. `list` was built on that, and re-running the same corpus
took `exec` to zero. A later run caught `exec find . -name .gyr`, because `list`
respects ignore rules and so cannot show what they hide; it now takes `all`.

**`search` earns its place, and only at scale.** Withheld on a ten-file crate it
cost nothing, which was a finding about the corpus rather than about search.
Withheld on a twenty-nine-module one it cost 41% more tokens and the model
reached for `exec grep`.

**The diagnostic gate was built, argued for, and withdrawn.** It tracked whether
an edit batch was converging. Two ablations at two workspace sizes found it cost
turns and tokens and changed no outcome, because `cargo check` already names the
failing files and so its verdict added nothing about *where*. On the case built
to be its best scenario, removing it made the run two turns and 8,560 tokens
shorter. The code and RFC-0011 stay; it is not in the tool set.

**A tool surface has a price.** A leaner one cost 26% fewer input tokens for
identical outcomes, well outside the measured 6.6% run-to-run noise floor.

Two rules the corpus applies to itself. A case where nothing changed fails even
if the code compiled, unless its deliverable is an answer rather than an edit.
And cases run unattended, therefore inside the sandbox, because unattended and
unconfined is the worst combination here.

## Models

The catalogue is explicit data rather than inference from a URL or a model-name
substring. An adapter may expose less than a model can do and never more.

| Key | Provider | Model |
|---|---|---|
| `terra` | OpenAI Responses | `gpt-5.6-terra` |
| `claude-opus` | Anthropic Messages | `claude-opus-5` |
| `claude-sonnet` | Anthropic Messages | `claude-sonnet-5` |
| `qwen3-coder-480b-a35b` | Qwen Chat Completions | `Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct` |
| `qwen3-coder-next` | Qwen Chat Completions | `Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-Next` |
| `qwen3-coder-30b-a3b` | Qwen Chat Completions | `Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct` |
| `qwen3.6-27b` | Qwen Chat Completions | `Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B` |
| `qwen3.6-35b-a3b` | Qwen Chat Completions | `Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B` |
| `qwen3-8b` | Qwen Chat Completions | `qwen3:8b` — development only |

Qwen's reference serving stacks are vLLM and SGLang. Ollama and other local
runtimes may follow once they pass the same conformance suite. `qwen3-8b` is
present so the loop can be driven by real inference on a laptop; it is not a
coding target, has been through no conformance suite, and `gyr models` says so
beside it.

## Using it

```console
cargo run -p gyr-cli -- models
cargo run -p gyr-cli -- prompt --model claude-sonnet
```

Running against a model needs that provider's credential in the environment:
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or `QWEN_API_BASE` for a self-hosted
endpoint. A missing one fails before any request is sent, naming the variable.

```console
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
gyr --model claude-sonnet
```

Or put the model in `~/.config/gyr/config.toml` and run `gyr`. `gyr config`
prints every setting and where its value came from.

Inside a session: `/help`, `/status`, `/log`, `/exit`. Ctrl-C cancels the current
turn and keeps the conversation; Ctrl-D leaves. Paste a stack trace and it
arrives as one message; end a typed line with a backslash to carry on. History
persists to `.gyr/history` and the conversation to `.gyr/sessions`, so
`gyr --resume` picks it up where you left it and `gyr replay` shows what
happened.

Mutations and processes ask before they happen. `--read-only` refuses both
instead; `--dangerously-allow-all` does not ask, which is a decision worth making
deliberately. A sandboxed run has no network, so Cargo runs `--offline` and
cannot fetch a dependency that is not already in the local registry cache: adding
a crate is a job for a person, or for `--sandbox none`.

For a script, CI or an eval, one submission and an exit code:

```console
gyr run --model claude-sonnet "what does gyr-core::Agent::run guarantee?"
```

Against a local endpoint:

```console
gyr --model qwen3-8b --api-base http://thinkpad.local:11434/v1 \
    --no-thinking --read-only
```

Ollama serves a context far smaller than the model's native window unless
`num_ctx` is raised, and it truncates rather than complaining. RFC-0003 section
3.1 records what has and has not been measured there.

The interface uses a warm dark palette because that is what it was drawn for.
Gyrfalcon ships the ink and leaves the background to the terminal, since a
line-based program does not own its ground. On a light terminal, `--plain`.

**What lands on disk.** `.gyr/` in the workspace holds the session log, the
resumable state and the input history. The log records what you typed; the state
holds the conversation, and the conversation holds your source, because tool
results are file contents. It is git-ignored and mode 0600, and it is worth
knowing it is there.

The command is `gyr`; Gyrfalcon is the project.

The RFCs are part of the project. Findings are labelled as measured, observed in
source, documented by a provider, or inferred. Quantitative claims carry a date
and method, because agent software changes too quickly for folklore to be a sound
dependency. Where a design was wrong and had to be corrected, the RFC records the
correction rather than quietly reading as though it were right all along.

## Development

```console
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all --check
gyr eval --model claude-sonnet   # needs a credential; not part of cargo test
```

CI runs the first three on macOS and Linux against a pinned toolchain. It found a
cross-platform defect on its first Linux build, before it had been asked to do
the thing it was added for.

Ten crates:

- `gyr-protocol` — values crossing crate and frontend boundaries.
- `gyr-model` — provider session traits and the explicit model catalogue.
- `gyr-core` — the act-observe loop, approval, the session log, the workspace
  fence, the context budget and the system prompt.
- `gyr-tools` — workspace filesystem tools and their hard output limits.
- `gyr-sandbox` — operating-system containment. Rewrites a command; never spawns.
- `gyr-confine` — the Linux helper: restricts itself with Landlock, then `exec`s.
- `gyr-exec` — the process runner and the `exec` tool.
- `gyr-rust` — the `cargo` tool, diagnostic parsing, and the withdrawn gate.
- `gyr-eval` — the case format, the runner, the metrics read from a log, and the
  one definition of what tools a session gets.
- `gyr-cli` — the `gyr` executable, its session loop, renderer, palette and
  approval prompt.

Tests that invoke a real `cargo` build a dependency-free fixture in a temporary
directory, so they need a toolchain but no network. The six confinement tests run
on both macOS and Linux, including the pair that rules out a sandbox which simply
refuses everything.
